                <h2>Prep 1: Tools</h2>
                <p>Before starting your build, you will need some tools to ensure that you have the right tools and a
                    nice
                    workplace
                    for the building process to go smoothly.</p>
                <p>Workplace: You will need a large surface to work on, such as a table or floor. If you do work on the
                    floor, make sure it is on an uncarpeted surface
                </p>
                <p>Screwdrivers: You will need a Phillips #2 screwdriver and a Phillips #0 screwdriver if you install an
                    M.2
                    device.</p>
                <p>USB flash drive: You will need an 8GB flash drive or larger to store the installer for the operating
                    system that you will use.</p>

                <h2>Prep 2: Gaming PC Cases</h2>
                <p>Before you start picking the parts for the PC, you should have a case in mind that you want to use.
                    There
                    are three sizes of cases: Full-tower, mid-tower, and mini-tower.</p>
